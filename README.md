# Weather Search

Simple React App to fetch local weather using the weather underground API. Uses the `conditions` endpoint to fetch current conditions for a given city with state/province.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have both `node` and a package manager, such as `npm` or `yarn`

### Installing

To run the development server:

```bash
cd weather-search
npm install
npm start
```

Visit the app at `http://localhost:3000`. That's it!

Enter a city/state combo to find out what the current weather is there!

## Running the tests

We're using Jest as the test runner. Execute the test suite by running `npm test`
